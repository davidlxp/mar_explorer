    * Trading in U.S. government bonds was supported by strong client activity in institutional and retail markets. Wholesale volumes reflected continued client adoption of Tradeweb protocols, as overall industry volumes declined. European government bond volumes were supported by ongoing hedge fund activity amid volatile markets as well as ongoing strong interest in UK Gilts.


  * Mortgage ADV was up 10.8% YoY to $166.6bn. 
    * Declining volatility and favorable valuations broadly supported to-be-announced (TBA) trading activity. Tradeweb reported record ADV in specified pool trading spurred by FDIC portfolio liquidations.

**credit**
  * Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 9.5% YoY to $4.5bn and European credit ADV was up 10.5% to $1.9bn.


    * U.S. credit volumes reflected continued client adoption across Tradeweb protocols, including sessions-based trading and Tradeweb AllTrade®, including record ADV in fully electronic U.S. High Grade credit all-to-all trading, as broader TRACE credit ADVs increased 3.3% YoY. Tradeweb’s share of fully electronic U.S. High Grade and U.S. High Yield TRACE was 14.1% and 5.8%, respectively. European credit volumes were strong, despite the additional UK bank holiday at the beginning of the month.[1]


  * Municipal bonds ADV was down 22.5% YoY to $321 million (mm).


    * Tradeweb volumes were down 22.5% versus the broader municipal bond market decline of 26.7%[2] YoY. Tradeweb volumes continued to be supported by increased client adoption of electronic protocols.


  * Credit derivatives ADV was down 51.1% YoY to $8.3bn. 
    * Subdued volumes reflected broader market declines, as broader industry SEF volumes declined 43.4%[3]


**equities**
  * U.S. ETF ADV was down 5.8% YoY to $7.2bn and European ETF ADV was down 14.2% to $2.4bn.

**money markets**
  * Repurchase agreement ADV was up 11.9% YoY to $470.2bn.


    * Continued client adoption of Tradeweb’s electronic trading solutions drove record global Repo activity, despite significant volatility in money markets and sustained elevated usage of the Federal Reserve’s reverse repo facility.

[1] The Coronation of His Majesty King Charles, May Day and Spring Bank Holiday resulted in three holidays in the UK in May 2023. Since markets in continental Europe were open on two of these days, only two days were counted as holidays in Tradeweb’s trading calendar. Therefore, there were 21 days in May for all European products rather than 20. Using 20 trading days would increase ADVs in those products by 5.0%.
